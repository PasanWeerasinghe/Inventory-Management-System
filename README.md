5. SYSTEM DESIGN
   
5.1 Architecture
The system employs a three-tier architecture to ensure scalability, modularity, and ease of 
maintenance:
Presentation Layer:
• Developed using JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
• Provides interactive and user-friendly interfaces, styled for usability.
Application Layer:
• Implements business logic using Java Servlets.
• Handles user requests, processes data, and interacts with the database.
Data Layer:
• A MySQL database serves as the persistent storage solution.
• Centralized database connections managed using JDBC.

5.2 Database Design
The database consists of the following key tables:
• users: Stores user information.
Fields: id (PK), username, email, password, role.
• items: Manages details about items in stock.
Fields: id (PK), name, quantity, price.
• orders: Tracks customer orders.
Fields: id (PK), user_id (FK to users.id), status, date.
• notifications: Logs alerts and messages for users.
Fields: id (PK), user_id (FK to users.id), message, timestamp.

5.3 Technologies Used
Frontend:
• JSP (Java Server Pages) and Servlets for building dynamic web pages.
• HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsive and styled user interfaces.
Backend:
• Java Servlets for handling application logic.
• JDBC for secure and efficient database connectivity.
Database:
• MySQL for managing and storing data persistently.
Server:
• Apache Tomcat as the application server for running JSP and Servlets.
